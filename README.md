Hey everyone , hope you all doing well


okay so, **What even is this script ?**

**so , with [build 4837](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/) for fxserver , there is a new native, to mute players in game, thanks to @AvarianKnight ,and it will work on any VOIP that is in game (like : _mumble-voip_ and _pma-voice_)**

I just wrote this and thought why not release it , maybe somebody else could use it too !

so , i modified it and added a little config file to it

features : 
* Works on every mumble based server (mumble-voip / PMA-voice and ...)
* Command for mute/unmute
* Command can be used from console too
* Also there is a menu for mute/unmute
* Discord Log System
* ESX Permission support
* QBCore permission support
* Identifier permission support
* Multi language support
* Very light on server and client

**YOU NEED TO BE ON THE BUILD NUMBER 4837 OR HIGHER FOR THIS TO WORK !!**

Hope you enjoy

**Installation :**

> Down the script from this github

> Copy it to your server `resources` folder

> (make sure you removed `-master` from end of the folder)

> Add `ensure mumble-mute` to your server config file

> Configure the config.lua file as you want

> Restart the server (or the script) and you are good to go !
